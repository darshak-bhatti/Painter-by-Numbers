# Painters By Numbers 

###Abstract

There are many great works of art throughout history whose creator remains unknown and experts debate who is responsible for them. Identifying the artist behind the painting is a unique and interesting challenge for art experts and computer scientists alike. We hope to build a system that can automate the process of artist identification based on feature extraction from images of paintings. We explore several methods for artist classification, including two versions of KNN, convolutional neural network, and texton-based analysis. We find texton-based analysis to be the most promising method, with the highest test and training accuracy. Applications of such a system can potentially go beyond artist identification and into forgery detection.

In this repository you will find we have implemented 4 types of analysis to solve the above problem.
1. Texton Based Analysis
2. CNN
3. RandomForest Classifier
4. KNN

The authors of each method of implementations are as follows:
1. Texton Based Analysis - Piyush Choudhary(pchoudh2@ncsu.edu), Mihir Mirajkar(mmmirajk@ncsu.edu)
2. CNN - Darshak Bhatti (dbhatti@ncsu.edu)
3. RandomForest Classifier and KNN - Erick Draayer (ecdraaye@ncsu.edu)
